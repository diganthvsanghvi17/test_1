#You have a football field that is 92 meter long and 48.8 meter wide. Find out total area using python and print it.

#create the variables
length = 92
breath = 48.8
# write the formula for area
area = length * breath
# print the output
print(area)

# You bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store. Each packet costs 1.49 dollar and you gave shopkeeper 20 dollar.
# Find out using python, how many dollars is the shopkeeper going to give you back?

#declaring variables

num_packets = 9
cost_chips = 1.49
money_given = 20

# calculating the total spend amount

total_spend_amount = num_packets * cost_chips
money_returned = money_given - total_spend_amount

# print the output
print(money_returned)
